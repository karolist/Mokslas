<P>2 compulsory misses occur; this is the first  time Lines 1 and 2 are accessed. <FONT COLOR="#0000cc"><code>min</code></FONT>  is in Line 1, which is not in the cache. The address of Line 1 is odd,  so this line is cached in Set 1, since 1 mod 2 = 1. The cache is empty,  so the line goes into Way 0.

<BR><FONT COLOR="#0000cc"><code>a[0]</code></FONT> is in Line  2; its address is even, so it's cached in Set 0. It also goes to Way 0.</td>
